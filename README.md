# Oddsportal-MoreSurebet

Oddsportal-MoreSurebet is a web crawler that finds odds for matches and outputs surebets.

A Surebet is a type of bet that CANNOT lose.
For example: a Home/Away bet with odds of 2.05 on a website and 2.1 in another website, will make a guaranteed ROI of 3.6 %

This project is unfinished and will always have updates.

## Features

- **Match scalper**: Looks for the match and gives any surebets. The user inputs a link to the match, no matter the bet type or the time, the scraper will output any surebet.
- **League scalper**: Takes a league, searches surebets.
- **Today matches**: Takes a day, searches surebets.

## To-do list

- Support all bookmakers (just change the XPATH with b1 and b2 user input).
- Make more tests.
- Create a main script to run 24/7.
- Implement Telegram notification when a surebet with more than X% was detected.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to learn how to use Selenium in Python. By building a web scraper that finds surebets, I hope to improve my skills in web scraping and data analysis. <br>
As a future data scientist, my goal is to learn more about automation using Python and related tools such as Selenium.

## Update

This code is not perfect it was my first try. I will add more features in the future but for now this project is in pause.
